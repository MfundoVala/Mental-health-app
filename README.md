# ApexTech : Sisa

Our goal is to create a space for open discussion among sufferers who may not have an avenue to be seen or heard. We couple this with access to mental health professionals in-app, to make reaching out for assistance easier for all, with a focus on those with physical and financial barriers. Additionally we aim is to centralise the mental health services as well as to create a platform for South Africans to take charge of their mental health from where they are.

Anyone can seek assistance to free and pre-existing South African Solutions as well as to individual, licensed mental health professionals through SiSa.
